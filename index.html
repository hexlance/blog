    <p>Welcome to Tarron! Home to mile-long sky bridges and underground lava mansions alike! Our most windy world is open to all travelers, settlers, and adventurers from any background and of any personality.

    I see you’re an adventurer, noble yet naive. You’ve just set foot on Genliath, the largest (and greatest) of the Seven Continents. The Seven Continents of Tarron are really more like islands, but nevermind that. You must know that Tarron is truly a water-world, only broken up by the Seven Continents.

    To the North you’ll see the great Arkenfall mountain range. It covers about half of Genliath. I know, it’s unfortunate; most of the continents are mountainous like this one. Look yonder to the South! The Great Archipelago of Luzbath lies there. Maybe you’ll visit it someday, but I’ll tell you that the trip is arduous and long.

    As we near the surface, make sure not to be dragged away by a cloud. Oh! You passed right through it. Oh well, I am much lighter than you (by the way, I’m a bird). We’ll try to land in that clearing. It’ll only be a few hours of a walk to the nearest village.

    See, now you know never to land on a rock again. Even falling onto a tree is better. Oh, why are humans so clumsy... Anyway. Make sure to grab your rucksack and head down that path across the fjord.

    Best wishes and good adventuring!
