					<b>Is Water Wet?</b>
					<p>Yes.

How do we confirm this? Well, much of the debate has been centered around two key ideas: the nature of physical properties, and how we observe things. 

One common fallacy committed by the other side of this argument is that water is not wet, it simply makes other things wet. However, this argument is invalid for two reasons. First, we can use the example of red ink and paper. Red ink is widely considered to be red, and it makes paper red. However, one can point out that the property of color is different from the property of “wetness,” and this leads us to the second reason: so what if water makes other things wet? Does this observation definitively show that water itself is not wet? I think not. The disjunction between “water simply makes other things wet” and “water is not wet” invalidates the fallacy.

On our side of the argument, we have an approach that uses strict physical analysis to justify the wetness of water, but even this approach has inherent contradictions. It states that because wet (adjective) is defined as covered or saturated in a liquid, all water is wet because water molecules constantly cover each other. But in fact, liquids do not make each other wet. Unlike a soggy piece of cardboard, there is no significant change when liquids meet each other related to their wetness property; they simply merge and stay as a liquid. Another counter-argument to the approach states that if the hypothesis is taken as true, then a single water molecule is not wet because it is not covered or saturated by water. Although this is a good point, we already demonstrated the futility of the argument it is countering. 

More importantly, the counter-argument leads to the main point. Water is much more similar to the Sun: the Sun makes things bright and it is widely accepted that the Sun itself is bright because of this property. As a whole entity, the Sun is bright because of the effects it has on our eyes. There is literally no other way to define brightness because it requires “secondhand” observation via photons hitting your eyes. But we don’t really know the nature of photons, and we cannot say that a photon is bright or not bright, simply because it does not have that “parameter” in its list of physical properties; it is a subatomic particle. Similarly, an H2O molecule on its own is exempt from the wetness property, negating the counter-argument and giving us insight into the crux of the problem: definitions. Water cannot be treated as a single water molecule, because water’s true properties are emergent. An atom of gold is not yellow or heavy or malleable (even though a gold bar is), because it is simply exempt from these traits.

The other side treats water like a candy machine; it dispenses "candy" but it itself is not "candy." However, this is a misunderstanding because candy machines require many intermediate steps to create candy that separate it from actually being candy. Water operates more similarly to the Sun, dispensing brightness (which we can confirm only through secondary observation via our eyes) and being bright itself. There are no necessary intermediate steps for an object to become observed as wet once the water exists on that object.

Property is a confusing thing. Physical properties must be observed, and once it is established that there are no intermediate steps between the object and our observation, then it is also established that the object possesses that physical property.

It is foolish to suggest that water is not wet because it only stimulates our neurons, and therefore it is not wet by itself. This is obviously invalid, as we consider red paper to be red because it stimulates our retinas. Just like the Sun and red paper, water is wet because we value its effects and consequences on our senses. We cannot judge water on a subatomic scale, nor can we separate the definition of having a property to the object itself.</p>
